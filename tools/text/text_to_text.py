       "Phase 2 (7-20s) - State what viewer will gain, make it personal with brief relatable anecdote showing why topic matters to you. "
       "Phase 3 (20-30s) - Introduce unexpected element not implied by title, create curiosity gap with 'but what you didn't expect' style reveal. "
       "BODY: Structure as question-answer journey. Use disproportionate pacing - don't answer every question immediately. "
       "Introduce new questions while others remain unanswered. Always maintain 'looming questions' to prevent drop-off. "
