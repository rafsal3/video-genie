  "script": "If you've been scrolling through the news, seeing headlines about AI's meteoric rise, and feeling that nagging doubt in the back of your mind – you've clicked on the right video. I've spent years tracking tech cycles, and I'm here to unpack what's really happening. Today, we're not just looking at the shiny promises; we're diving deep into the very real concerns that the AI revolution might be heading for a massive bust, echoing some of the biggest crashes in history. For me, seeing the echoes of past tech bubbles, it feels critical to understand if we're making the same mistakes again, and what that means for all of us invested in this future. You might expect the red flags to be just about inflated stock prices. But what if the biggest indicator of an impending crash isn't on Wall Street at all, but rather, is already starting to reveal itself in the very technology meant to lead the charge? So, what exactly are these cracks appearing beneath the surface of the AI boom? Many are drawing stark parallels to the dot-com era, where exuberance overtook reality, and companies with little more than a website were valued in the billions. But here's the thing: it’s not just a feeling this time; we’re seeing concrete indicators. Remember all the hype around the next generation of AI models? Well, when GPT-5 finally arrived, the reaction wasn't a roar of innovation, but a collective shrug. Its performance, frankly, was underwhelming. And that, surprisingly, has been a massive catalyst for market jitters, leaving many to wonder if we're hitting a plateau sooner than anyone expected. But it gets worse. It's not just the headline-grabbing models. Companies rushing to implement generative AI are facing a brutal reality: a high failure rate for pilot projects. Imagine investing millions, only for your grand AI experiment to fizzle out. This isn't just about disappointment; it's about wasted capital and shattered confidence. Now, you might think these are just growing pains, right? But what if the very architects of AI are saying we've got it all wrong? That's exactly what prominent AI researcher Gary Marcus argues. He's been vocal, calling out that the expectations of Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, are not just premature, but based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what current AI can actually do. He suggests we're building castles on sand, confusing pattern recognition with true intelligence. So, what are the big players on Wall Street saying about all this? It’s a divided room. On one hand, you have analysts cautiously optimistic, holding onto the long-term vision of AI driving efficiency and productivity across industries. They see this as a necessary investment for future growth. And that sounds reassuring, doesn't it? But here's the thing: others, like Deutsche Bank's Torsten Slok, are sounding a much louder alarm. He's openly warning about massively overvalued tech stocks, fuelled by the AI craze. And it's not just stock prices. Companies are pouring staggering amounts of money into building new data centers – the physical infrastructure for this AI boom. It's an investment spree that, for many, feels eerily reminiscent of the dot-com bubble's infrastructure overbuild, where capacity far outstripped demand, leading to massive losses. So, with underwhelming tech, failed corporate pilots, experts warning against hype, and Wall Street itself divided, the question isn't just 'is there an AI bubble?' but 'are we already seeing it deflate, and what comes next for this revolutionary, yet perhaps overhyped, technology?'"
